Uplink global bandwidth measurement.

This method computes the number of iterations it takes to empty the packet queue of each node within the network.

Args:
    G (DiGraph): The DAG
    adj_matrix (ndarray): The adjacency matrix describing the topology
    epoch_len (int): Number of time to run the simulation to average result. This is required because there is a basic CSMA/CA mechanism which introduces some randomness.
    packets_per_node (int): Initial packet count in each node queue
    max_steps (int): Early stop condition. This helps not to run simulation uselessly if the number of steps is above a provided threshold. This can be dynamically updated when more and more DAGs have been evaluated to spare time.
